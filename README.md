# compiler-design.py

1. DAG Visualization: The code uses the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries to create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and visualize it using a plot.

2. Postfix to Prefix Conversion: The code defines a function that converts an arithmetic expression from postfix notation to prefix notation using a stack data structure.

3. Regular Expression to Finite Automaton Conversion: The code demonstrates how to convert a regular expression to a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) using the PyFormLang library.

4. LR Parsing: The code defines a grammar and uses the Lark library to generate a parse tree for a given expression.

5. Left Recursion Handling: The code demonstrates left recursion handling using the PyParsing library.

6. First and Follow Sets: The code defines a grammar and uses the Grako library to compute the first and follow sets for each rule in the grammar.

7. Tokenization: The code uses the NLTK library to tokenize a given text into words.

8. Quadruple, Triple, and Double Classes: The code defines classes representing quadruples, triples, and doubles with different attributes.

9. Lexical Analysis: The code performs lexical analysis on a given text, extracting keywords, operators, and punctuators.

10. First and Follow Sets (NLTK): The code defines a grammar and uses the NLTK library to compute the first and follow sets for each non-terminal symbol in the grammar.

11. Regular Expression to Finite Automaton Conversion (PyFormLang): The code demonstrates how to convert a regular expression to a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) and then to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) using the PyFormLang library.

12. Postfix Expression Evaluation: The code defines a function that evaluates a given postfix arithmetic expression using a stack data structure.

13. Tokenization (NLTK): The code uses the NLTK library to tokenize a given text into words.

14. Quadruple, Triplet, and Doublet Classes: The code defines classes representing quadruples, triplets, and doublets with different attributes.
